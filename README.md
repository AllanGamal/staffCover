  <h3>GUI Design</h3>
   
  <p>Designed the basic template for the application with a home, teams and employee tabs, giving it room to expande the project with potentially more tabs. Also added added, change and remove-buttons for both the teams and employees tab to their respective table.
  
  Next thing to be added is the button functionality to add team and fitters so a basic version of the application can be tested.

   <h3>Design update and functionality implementations</h3>
   
  <p>
  Updated the design on the "Team" page so I have list of stations and employees in two different list within the team, instead of making a table. Table in this case do not work since I wanted two independently columns. Also added functionality to add team/remove, stations and employees, and also able to add/remove competency to a list within every employee.
