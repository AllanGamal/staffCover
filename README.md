   <h3>GUI Design</h3>
   
  <p>Designed the basic template for the application with a home, teams and employee tabs, giving it room to expande the project with potentially more tabs. Also added added, change and remove-buttons for both the teams and employees tab to their respective table.
  
  Next thing to be added is the button functionality to add team and fitters so a basic version of the application can be tested.
